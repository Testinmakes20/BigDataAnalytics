<h1>20090202 Release Notes</h1>

<p>
The goal for this release was to increase the number of versions available
of existing systems in anticipation of studies about software
evolution. There are no new systems, but there are 141 new versions of
11 systems, giving a total of 400 versions overall of 100 systems, with
23 systems having more than one version. While some of the added versions
were newer than what was already in the corpus, most were older.

<p>
There were also some efforts made to improve quality, especially for the
metadata.

<dl>
<dt>Terminology change: "Application" --> "System"</dt>
<dd>
After continuing to encounter (quite understandable) confusion as to what we
mean by application (of the form "So you don't include libraries like jgraph
in your corpus?") we have decided to change our terminology.  All the
documentation has (or should have) been changed to reflect this, but the
corpus will keep the "Applications" directory (as a symbolic link) for the
time being.


<dt>Change versions</dt>
<dd>
itext-1.4 changed name to itext-1.4.5. In the previous releases, 
the itext-1.4 bin was actually for 1.4.5, but the source was for
1.4. Since most previous analysis was done on the bin, it was decided
to change the name of this release and include the correct version of
the source.

only the relevant one has been kept. The properties file contains
a note regarding a peculiarity regarding its contents.

For changed version of itext,

what the <a href="../catalogue/index.html">catalogue</a> looks like, and dealing with the change of terminology.

<p>For the web distribution of the corpus, added a file containing
assembly instructions.
