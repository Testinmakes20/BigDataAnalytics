<h1>History of the Qualitas Corpus</h1>

<p>
The Qualitas Corpus was initially conceived and developed by
<a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~hayden">Hayden Melton</a> for his Phd
research during 2005. Hayden designed much of the structure and put together
its initial contents, and made it available to others within the Qualitas
Research Group to use.

<p>
The next major development of the corpus was made by Homan Ma, who
contributed a significant number of new applications to support his ME
research during 2006.

<p>
During 2007, work began to package the corpus to allow its distribution to
other research groups. Ted Han did much of this work. The first distribution
of the corpus was in January of 2008.

<p>
After the first release in 2008, there were two more releases during
the first half of that year, growing the corpus to a nice round number
of systems (100) and generally exercising the processes for creating
releases.

<p>
During the latter part of 2008 and again in 2010, Jing Li significantly grew
the corpus, adding a large number of versions of existing applications and
also developing infrastructure to aid distribution.

<p>
During 2010, Jonathan Chow added new versions and worked on the
infrastructure, and Alexander Blinder added many new versions.

<p>
Ewan Tempero has project-managed the development and all public releases of
the corpus.

<p>
Until the first distribution, the contents of the corpus changed to reflect
the needs of the studies that were carried out using it, and the experience
we gained in how to organise the corpus. The best indication of the growth
of the corpus is reflected in the
<a href="../publications/index.html">publications</a> that were based on it.
