<h1>Qualitas Corpus System Status</h1>

Our <a href="#available">criteria</a> regarding what systems are included in
the corpus are such that we try to only include systems that will remain
actively developed. As this requires predicting the future, we sometimes get
it wrong. As some users of the corpus may wish to only target those systems
under active development, we include metadata that indicates, according to
our understanding, the status of each system. The status codes are 
as follows:-

<dl>
<dt><b>Active</b></dt>
<dd>
All indications are that the system's developers intend there to be
future development on the system, even if there has been none for a long
time. 
</dd>

<dt><b>Dead</b></dt>
<dd>
Known to be no longer under development, typically by an explicit declaration
by those associated with it. Where (and what) the declaration is should be
included in the <a href="brokenlink">system notes</a>.
</dd>

<dt><b>Dormant</b></dt>
<dd>
The developers have explicitly stated there is currently no active
development and no plans for any, but there may be at some point in the
future. The <a href="brokenlink">system notes</a> should indicate what
the statement was.
</dd>

<dt><b>Moribund</b></dt>
<dd>
There has been no development for some time and no evidence that there will
be any in the future, but it has not been declared dead and there seems
still the possibility for future development.
The <a href="brokenlink">system notes</a> should indicate on what
basis this status was chosen.
</dd>


<dt><b>Defunct</b></dt>
<dd>
There has been no development for some time, no evidence that there will
be any in the future, and it has not been declared dead. But all
indications are there is unlikely to be any future development.
The <a href="brokenlink">system notes</a> should indicate on what
basis this status was chosen.
</dd>

<dt><b>Closed</b></dt>
<dd>
Has become closed source.
The <a href="brokenlink">system notes</a> should indicate on what basis
this status was chosen.
</dd>

<dt><b>Lost</b></dt>
<dd>
Can no longer find any official record of its existence.
The <a href="brokenlink">system notes</a> should indicate on what basis
this status was chosen.
</dd>

<dt><b>Retired</b></dt>
<dd>
No longer under development in this form, but now exists in some other form.
The <a href="brokenlink">system notes</a> should indicate on what basis
this status was chosen, in particular what the other form is.
</dd>
</dl>

Needless to say, some choices of status are a judgement call on our part.
For example, we may have missed an announcement regarding a system that
would mean its real status is different to what we say.
