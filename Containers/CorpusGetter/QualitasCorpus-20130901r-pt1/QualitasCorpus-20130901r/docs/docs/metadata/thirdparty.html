<h1>Qualitas Corpus Third Party Libraries</h1>

<em>The plan is to work towards providing complete systems, including
any third-party libraries used, however it will not be completed
for the July 2010 release. The information on this page is the
first step towards achieving this. Note that it is a preliminary
list only. <b>Note:</b> This information has mainly been determined
from the most recent release of the system. Since the versions we
have of some systems are quite old, its possible the information
here does not apply to what we have in the corpus.!</em>
