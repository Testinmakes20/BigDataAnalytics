Licensing requirements for downloading Java from Oracle are such that we
cannot distribute that software as part of the Qualitas Corpus.

We have, however, provided the relevant metadata (.properties file) and made
the decision as to what we consider to be part of this application.  Those
who wish to include the JRE in their distribution of the Qualitas Corpus
should download the JRE distribution.

1. Download the linux distribution for the Java Java SE Development Kit 6u21
   release. 
   Specifically you need to download the file jdk-6u21-linux-i586.bin

   In the past, a good starting point to find this has been
   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads and then
   "Previous Releases". These days you also need to have an oracle.com
   account (which at the time of writing you can register for one for free).

2. Download jdk-6u21-linux-i586.bin.  and put it in the "compressed"
   directory for jre-1.6.0.

3. Execute jdk-6u21-linux-i586.bin (you might have to make it executable
   first).  This will result in a directory named something like
   jdk1.6.0_21.

4. Rename jdk1.6.0_21 to jdk1.6.0 (i.e. remove the release number).  This is
   so that the .install file will execute properly.

5. Create a tar file, using tar -cf jdk-1.6.0.tar jdk1.6.0 (note the
   inclusion of a "-" in the tar file name).

6. Execute the .install file in the jdk-1.6.0 directory in the corpus
   distribution as
     ./.install .
   You should see:
                 unpacking jdk-1.6.0.tar
                 unpacking jdk-1.6.0.tar

7. Confirm that everything has worked. You should see:
   * "bin" should contain only jdk1.6.0/jre/lib/rt.jar
   * "src" should contain at least jdk1.6.0/src, which has all of the
     source provided. (This directory has been unpacked from
     jdk1.6.0/src.zip.)

Notes:

* These instructions are for Linux. Make changes relevant to your OS as
  required.

* The .properties and contents.csv provide here are for release 21. This
  release has not always been available, so you may need to download a later
  release.
