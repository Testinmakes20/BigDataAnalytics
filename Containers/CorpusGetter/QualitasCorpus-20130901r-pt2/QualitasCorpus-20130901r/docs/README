===================
  QUALITAS CORPUS  
===================

The Qualitas Corpus is a collection of open-source systems for use in
empirical studies. It provides both source and compiled distributions of the
systems as well as metadata about the systems. See index.html for details.


Contents
========

The top level of the distribution contains:

    Systems:   Contains the collection of systems. 
    bin:       Contains Perl scripts to be used on the corpus.
    docs:      Contains documentation for the corpus. See 
               docs/index.html
    metadata:  Some of the metadata provided. See docs/metadata/index.html.
    README:    This file.


System requirements and other notes
===================================

All installation scripts are written in Perl and have been tested running 
Ubuntu 10.04, and should also work under various other Linux environments.

Note that file systems that are not case sensitive (e.g., Mac OS under some
configurations) will have problems. Windows file systems have had problems
in the past (file names too long) but Windows 7 has not been tested.

See docs/docs/acquisition.html for information on how much disk space is needed.

It is also possible to manually unpack individual systems using
standard archiving tools.

Due to licensing restrictions the JRE binaries and source is NOT in this
distribution. See Systems/jre/*/QC_README for details on how to add jre to
your corpus installation.


Installation
============

To unpack the corpus, execute the Perl script 'install.pl' from inside bin.
See docs/docs/software/install.html. To unpack in place, use
   bin/install.pl


Corpus Use
==========

The Qualitas Corpus contains a collection of different software systems
acquired from other sources. To the best of our understanding, distribution
of these systems in the corpus is consistent with the terms and conditions
of their license agreements or notices.  Use of the contents of each system
is governed by the terms and conditions of license agreements or notices
indicated by each individual system.  All content is provided "as is"
without any warranties of any kind.
