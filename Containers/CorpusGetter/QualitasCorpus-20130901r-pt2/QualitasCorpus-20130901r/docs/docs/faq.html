There are two main reasons why the corpus is not available for direct
download. One is, we want to have some idea of the interest in its use and
the degree to which it is being used. At the moment, the interest is low
enough that the manual "email for access" method works just fine. You
will usually get a response in under a day. If
interest picks up, we may introduce an auto-response method for access.

<p>Note that once you know the location for downloads, you are welcome to
continue to access it whenever you like. So if a new release is made, you do
not need to check with us before acquiring it.

<p>The other reason is that New Zealand's international internet connection
is only slightly better than a piece of damp string and there are costs
involved with its use. All indications are that this isn't a huge problem,
but we have been cautious about
allowing <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/slather">open
slather</a> on the corpus.

<p><dt><a name="contributors">Is there other work done on the 
Qualitas Corpus?</dt>
<dd>
Yes, some of which are listed below.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://java.labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/qualitas.class">Qualitas.class</a>
UFMG, Brazil

</ul>
</dd>

<p><dt><a name="thirdparty">Some of the systems seem to be missing libraries so they cannot be executed?</a><br/>
<a name="dynamic">I want to do studies involving dynamic analysis, can I use
the corpus for this</a>?</dt>

<dd>
The corpus was designed with static analysis in mind so we have not made
much effort to ensure the systems are executable. In particular, to simplify
the cost of adding new systems, we do not try to find any missing libraries
(part of the cost is figuring out which version of the library should be
included).

<p>However we have had a number of requests regarding using it for dynamic
analysis, so we would like to make it more useful eventually. Unfortunately
lack of resources mean that this is likely to take a while. As a first step,
we have identified those systems that either do not use third-party
libraries, or provide the third-party libraries as part of their
distributions (see <a href="metadata/thirdparty.html">this list</a>). These
systems, in principle, should be able to be executed. This information is
still in a fairly raw state, so should be treated with caution.

<p>Those who need systems that can execute may like to try 
<a href="#related">other corpora</a>.

<dt><a name="interactive">Is there any way I can interactively, or otherwise
explore the corpus?</a></dt>
<dd>
There is nothing in the corpus itself to support exploring the corpus other
than the <a href="catalogue/index.html">catalogue</a>. However people are using the corpus
is input to their tools. For example
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://xplrarc.massey.ac.nz">Massey Architecture Explorer</a> by Jens Dietrich and
his group at Massey University, New Zealand.
</ul>
</dd>

<p><dt><a name="windows">The corpus seems to have problems installing on
windows. Is there a distribution for windows?</a></dt>
<dd>
We've had some reports of problems installing on windows. Some
seem to relate to long filenames or filenames with non ASCII characters. Others
related to the installer script not properly handling spaces in filenames.
It's possible there are no problems on Windows 7, but this has not been confirmed.
There are no plans to produce a distribution that has been tested for Windows.
</dd>

<p><dt><a name="related">What other software corpora are there?</a><br/>
<a name="specialised">I need a collection of systems with specific characteristics. Does the corpus have such?</a></dt>
<dd>
As noted <a href="#dynamic">above</a>, the Qualitas Corpus was designed with
static analysis in mind. There are other corpora that have been created
with this goal in mind, but they do not appear to be actively maintained.
There are also corpora that have been created with other goals in mind.
Those we know to be actively maintained are:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dacapobench.org">DaCapo</a> for performance testing
<li><a href="http://sir.unl.edu/portal/index.php">Software Infrastructure
Repository</a> for research on software testing
</ul>
</dd>

<p><dt><a name="projects">What are other related projects?</a></dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://promisedata.org">PROMISE data</a> A "site where researchers can publish their data and the tools used to make their conclusions".
<li><a href="http://evaluate.inf.usi.ch/">Collaboratory on Experimental Evaluation of Software and Systems in Computer Science</a> "This web site serves as a resource and a hub for everybody interested in understanding and improving the state of practice in experimental evaluation."
