<h1>Qualitas Corpus Conventions</h1>

<h3>Naming conventions</h3>

<p>All directories containing system code are named as:
<pre>        <b>&lt;sysname&gt;-&lt;versionid&gt;</b></pre>

<dl>
<dt><i>&lt;sysname&gt;</i></dt>
<dd>A unique name, typically the one used to identify the system
(although see the <a href="metadata/attributes.html#fullname">fullname</a> field
in the metadata).
This name does <em>not</em> contain "-" in it. If the original
name does have a "-", then 
&lt;sysname&gt; will be the original name with "-" replaced
with a "_". E.g., <tt>eclipse_SDK</tt> from
<tt>eclipse-SDK</tt>.

<dt><i>&lt;versionid&gt;</i></dt>
<dd>The version, it should be specific as possible and typically
will be based on the version identification used to identify
the distribution file of the version. 

<p>For example,
if the compressed file is named <i>openjms-0.7.7-alpha-3.tgz</i> then the
<i>&lt;versionid&gt;</i> would be <i>0.7.7-alpha-3</i>. Note that
the exact id string is used, including occurrences of "-", and
no "tidying" has been done, such as to make it
<i>0.7.7</i>.
<p>
By and large <i>&lt;versionid&gt;</i> should not be changed from
what is used by the developers although note that the version
identification used by developers is not always what is used for
naming
the compressed file. In such cases, use what the developers use is
what is used in the corpus.
