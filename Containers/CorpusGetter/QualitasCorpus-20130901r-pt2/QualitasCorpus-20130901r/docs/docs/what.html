<h1>Qualitas Corpus Contents Summary</h1>

When you <a href="acquisition.html">acquire</a> a distribution
of the corpus, you get:
<ol>
<li>for every version of every system included, the
<em>original archive files</em> as available on the download site for the
system.
<ul>
<li> This includes both the "deployed" system
(i.e. the compiled <a href="glossary.html#bin">"bin"</a> form as supplied) and the
provided source</a> (<a href="glossary.html#src">"src"</a> possibly as a separate
archive file).
<li> It does <em>not</em> include any third-party libraries needed for the
system to execute <em>except</em> for those in the deployed archive file
(this means that what is in the corpus may not be able to be executed).
<li> It <em>may</em> include test cases, examples, or other infrastructure code, but only if that is provided in the archive files.
<li> An original archive file may also be provided in a repackaged form
(but the original will be provided as well).
</ul>
<li>
Metadata for overall <a href="metadata/attributes.html">systems</a> and
individual <a href="metadata/contents.html">classes</a> about the contents
of the corpus.
<ul>
  <li> This includes a <a href="metadata/attributes.html#sourcepackages">specification</a> of which classes to include in
    analysis (since source distributions often include example and test code)
  <li> 6 different <a href="glossary.html#size">size</a> measurements for each
    system
  <li> 2 LOC measurements for each class that source code has been provided
    for.
  <li> and more.
</ul>
<li>
An installer script that will unpack the archive files into a more useful structure.
</ol>
