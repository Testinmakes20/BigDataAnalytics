<h1>Early Development of the Corpus</h1>

These publications were based on the corpus before its organisation into a
form for external distribution. They are listed in order the studies were
carried out, rather than publication order (which due to the vagarities of
publication schedules can be quite different), in order to provide a view of
the growth of the corpus.

<blockquote>
This paper discussed Azureus, Tomcat, Eclipse, and Netbeans, although
a few more (probably about 10 in total) systems had been
gathered, using the <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/504282.504300">
Purdue Benchmark Suite</a> as the starting point. At
this point only sources were being gathered.

<blockquote>
This study was on the bytecode of 78 systems, 8 of which were commercial.
It was around the time of this study that we began deliberately 
gathering multiple versions of systems for longitudinal studies.
</blockquote>
<!--
-78 Open-source and closed-source systems (some were offsite, because
the companies wouldn't release their source code to us).
- Realised we needed both the source and binaries during the course of doing
this work (time and effort to make things compile (compiling eclipse was taking
over 10mins on my box, finding all the libraires, modifying all the ant scripts
just made things too diifcult).
- Realised we needed to store where we got the software from, what the domain
was etc to justify representativeness.
- Realised we needed to demarcate source-declared classes from library
classes when doing bytecode analysis (did so using package prefixes)
- ALSO added multiple versions of each system to do what Notkin terms
``longitudinal analysis''.

<blockquote>
This study was on the bytecode of 56 systems.
</blockquote>

<!--
-Integrated what the ElvisBrain group at Vic had in their corpus into ours
(had to redownload all their stuff from the internet in order to record website
downloaded from, domain, etc).
-56 systems (just the open-source ones from the corpus, no longitudinal
analysis).

This used systems in the corpus to test the performance
(space and time) of the tool the paper reports on.
</blockquote>
<!--
- Used only a subset of the corpus (for space reasons in the paper) to test
the performance (Space and time) of a tool for analysing code in real time (as
it's written).

This study was on the bytecode of the latest versions
we had of 81 systems.
</blockquote>

<!--
- First situation where doing something in source code would have been
difficult. Bytecode has all the name bindings and a special invokestatic or
get- and set-static instructions for doing a correlation between cycles and
static members.
-Used 81 systems, only latest versions in the corpus.
