<h1>20130901 Release Notes</h1>

<p>The goal for this release was to try to get complete information
on the 
<a href="../metadata/attributes.html#license">licenses</a> used by the
different sysvers. 

<p>One new system was added (<tt>jstock</tt> and the evolution release
systems were updated with all their new versions since the last release of
the corpus.  <tt>jstock</tt> was also added as an evolution system.

<dt>Metadata</dt>
<dd>
The main change to the metadata is that many of the values for
the <a href="../metadata/attributes.html#license">license attribute</a> of
sysvers have been added. Most systems already had some kind of license
information for their latest version, however it was incomplete and
inconsistent.  

<p>In this release, all existing license values have been updated to a
standard format and many more have been
added. <a href="../metadata/license.html">Details</a> of what is available
as well as an assessment of the quality. As almost every sysver had values
for the license changed, the changes are not explicilty listed here.

<p>An issue has been discovered with some of the metadata. A number of
sysvers have multiple source files for the same types. While we have been
aware of this, we have assumed that they are just multiple copies of the
same file. Improved checking for this release has revealed this is not
always the case. There is occassionally multiple different source files for
the same type. This is particularly a problem for measuring the various size
metrics, as only one source file is used per type. In resolving this issue
some of the size measurements are different for this release than they were
for the last release. This only applies to sysvers where there are multiple
source files for a type (a small number), and when the multiple files are
not duplicates of each other (an even smaller number), meaning the
differences are not large (typically well under 1%). But be aware of this
issue. The sysvers affected are:

antlr-3.1.2, batik-1.7, checkstyle-4.2, checkstyle-4.3, checkstyle-4.1,
compiere-330, eclipse_SDK-3.4 to eclipse_SDK-3.7.1, gt2-2.2-rc3, gt2-2.7-M3,
ivatagroupware-0.11.3, james-2.2.0, lucene-1.9-final, lucene-1.9.1,

springframework-3.0.5, struts-2.2.1, tomcat-5.5.17, wct-1.5.2.


<p>The <a href="../metadata/attributes.html#distribution">distribution</a>
values have been updated as appropriate for the 'e' systems (this
means changing which is specified as being in the 'r' distribution).
