<h1>20101126 Release Notes</h1>

<p>The goal for this release was to update every system were possible, since
many of the versions in the corpus were many years old (for systems for
which there were only 1 or 2 or so versions). There were also, for the first
time in a while, some new systems added. These were mainly medium to large
sized systems (as measured by number of top-level types). 

<p>There were also further improvements made to the quality assurance
procedues, which resulted in several problems with the metadata of several
versions in past releases. The details of these problems are given below.

<p>This release added 6 new systems, and 84 new versions for existing
systems, giving a total of 585 versions overall of 106 systems. The "e"
release has 13 systems, with a total of 414 versions.

<p>In this release, there has been a change made to how it is distributed.
The distributions provided by default will be the standard "r" distribution
and a new "e" distribution. The "r" distribution has versions of 106 systems
(2.9 GiB uninstalled, 8.5 GiB installed).  The "e" distribution will contain
just those systems for which there are 10 or more versions. This
distribution (9.3 GiB uninstalled, 31.9 GiB installed) is intended for
evolution studies. The full distribution (at 12.5 GiB uninstalled, 42.0 GiB
installed) can be made available on request.

<dt>Metadata</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>
The naming convention for metadata for individual systems has
changed. Instead of this being in <tt>contents.<b>txt</b></tt> it
is now in <tt>contents.<b>csv</b></tt> (so that spreadsheet applications
will more easily load these files). 
<li>
Metadata information now exists for all versions in the corpus.
<li>
All of the metadata files in the previous release had incorrectly-computed
values for the top-level (and related) types, so have all been regenerated.
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Changed versions</dt>
<dd>
<tt>jre-1.5.0_14-linux-i586</tt> has been changed to <tt>jre-1.5.0_22</tt>.
The issue is that as the source and binary for <tt>jre</tt> is not
distributed and there appears to be no way to get release 14 of
<tt>jre-1.5.0</tt>. Since <tt>jre-1.5.0</tt> is no longer supported,
we have decided to provide the metadata for its last release, namely
22. This way, anyone downloading <tt>jre-1.5.0</tt> should get the
same content that we used to generate the metadata.
Accordingly we have "changed"  <tt>jre-1.5.0_14-linux-i586</tt> to 
<tt>jre-1.5.0_22</tt>.
