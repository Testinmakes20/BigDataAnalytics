<h1>Acquiring the Qualitas Corpus</h1>

The Qualitas Corpus is available by contacting 
<a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~ewan/index.html">Ewan Tempero</a>.
Identify the distribution required and email him.

<p>There are several distributions of the corpus available. These include
earlier releases, as well as different variants of the current release.
They are listed below with the most recent releases first. 

<h2>20130901</h2>
<dl>
<dt>r</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The recent versions release; the 112 systems, but only the most recent
version of each system that we have. (Note that for some systems, mainly
those that appear to be no longer active, the version we have can be quite
old).  This is intended for breadth studies. It is 3.31 GiB uninstalled and
9.65 GiB installed (not including <tt>jre</tt>).

</dd>
<dt>e</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The evolution release; the 15 systems for which we have 10 or more versions,
a total of 579 versions. This is intended for studies on software
evolution. It is 16.75 GiB uninstalled and 62.98 GiB installed (not including
<tt>jre</tt>).
</dd>

<dt>f</dt>
<dd>
The complete corpus consists of 754 versions from 
112 systems. It is 20.34 GiB uninstalled and 73.80 GiB installed
(not including <tt>jre</tt>). This is not available as a single
distribution. The 'r' and 'e' distributions contain almost all
of the complete corpus. This 'f' distribution contains what is not
contained in one (or both) of the 'r' or 'e' distributions (0.84 GiB). To get
the complete corpus, download each of the 'r', 'e', and 'f'
distributions and unpack the archive files in the same place. The
installation will then work as for each individual distribution.

</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Past</h2>

These are distributions that have been made available in the past. They
are not directly available now, but can be provided if required.

<dl>
<dt>20120401r</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The recent versions release; the 111 systems, but only the most recent
version of each system that we have. (Note that for some systems, mainly
those that appear to be no longer active, the version we have can be quite
old).  This is intended for breadth studies. It is 3.27 GiB uninstalled and
9.57 GiB installed (not including <tt>jre</tt>).

</dd>
<dt>20120401e</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The evolution release; the 14 systems for which we have 10 or more versions,
a total of 486 versions. This is intended for studies on software
evolution. It is 12.12 GiB uninstalled and 45.64 GiB installed (not including
<tt>jre</tt>).
</dd>

<dt>20120401f</dt>
<dd>
The complete corpus consists of 661 versions from 
111 systems. It is 15.69 GiB uninstalled and 56.20 GiB installed
(not including <tt>jre</tt>). This is not available as a single
distribution. The 'r' and 'e' distributions contain almost all
of the complete corpus. This 'f' distribution contains what is not
contained in one (or both) of the 'r' or 'e' distributions. To get
the complete corpus, download each of the 'r', 'e', and 'f'
distributions and unpack the archive files in the same place. The
installation will then work as for each individual distribution.

</dd>

<dt>20101126r</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The recent versions release; the 106 systems, but only the most recent
version of each system that we have. (Note that for some systems, mainly
those that appear to be no longer active, the version we have can be quite
old).  This is intended for breadth studies. It is 2.9 GiB uninstalled and
8.5 GiB installed (not including <tt>jre</tt>).

</dd>
<dt>20101126e</dt>
<dd>
<p>
The evolution release; the 13 systems for which we have 10 or more versions,
a total of 414 versions. This is intended for studies on software
evolution. It is 9.3 GiB uninstalled and 31.9 GiB installed (not including
<tt>jre</tt>).
</dd>

<dt>20101126</dt>
<dd>
The complete corpus consists of 585 versions from 
106 systems. It is 12.5 GiB uninstalled and 42.0 GiB installed
(not including <tt>jre</tt>).
This is not distributed by default, but is available by request.
</dd>

<dt>20100719</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the complete corpus, with all 100 systems and every version
of each system that we have. 
(9.42GiB/10.12GB distributed, 32.80GiB when installed)
</dd>

<dt>20100719r</dt>
<dd>
<p>The recent releases; the 100 systems, but only the most recent version of
each system that we have. (Note that for some systems the version we have
can be quite old). Useful if you only do breadth studies, and not studies of
system evolution, and so don't need the complete distribution. The
contents of this distribution should be a proper subset of the
complete distribution. The separate identifier is therefore only necessary
to identify the distribution being used in case there are issues.
(1.39GiB/1.48GB distributed, 4.52GiB installed)</p>
</dd>

<dt>20090202</dt>
<dd>
<p><em>Replaced by 20100719. 
Useful if you want to replicate studies based on this release.</em></p>

<p>This is the complete corpus, with all 100 systems and every version
of each system that we have. 
This release has two distributions available:
<ul>
 <li>Everything (5.4GiB distributed, 18.75GiB when installed)
 <li>The diff; all changes (including corrections) that have been made since
     the previous release (20080603) . Useful if you want the complete
     corpus but already have the previous release, and especially if
     acquiring it through a network. (2.6GiB distributed, 10.25GiB installed).
</ul></p>

</dd>

<dt>20080603c</dt>
<dd>
<p>The corrected version of the 20080603 release. Useful if you really want to
reproduce studies done on this version, but don't want to have to find the
relevant versions of systems from the complete corpus or acquire the
complete corpus. (2.8GiB distributed, 8.6GiB installed)</p>
</dd>

<dt>20080603</dt>
<dd>
<p>You really really only want exactly what was used in studies on this
release. (2.8GiB distributed, 8.6GiB installed)</p>
