<h1>Installing the Qualitas Corpus</h1>


The installation process is slightly different, depending on whether the
distribution is on writable or non-writable media. If the distribution is
a <tt>tar</tt> or <tt>zip</tt> file, unpack it in the desired location of
the corpus. Execute the perl
script <tt><a href="software/install.html">install.pl</a></tt> found in
the <tt>bin</tt> directory (see the <a href="distribution.html">
distribution structure</a>). See the
<a href="software/install.html">instructions</a> for <tt>install.pl</tt> for
more details.

<p>The <tt><a href="software/install.html">install.pl</a></tt> script
unpacks the various <a href="structure.html#compressed">archive files</a> and does
other organsiation, and is necessary in order for the corpus to be in a
state useful for analysis.

<h3><font color=red>Important Note</font></h3>

Due to licensing restrictions the JRE binaries and source is <b>not</b> in
this distribution. In order to include the JRE in a given installation, it
must be downloaded directly
from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase">Oracle</a> and
installed manually.  Instructions are given in the relevant directory
within <a href="structure.html">Systems</a>.
