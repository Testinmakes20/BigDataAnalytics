<h1>Qualitas Corpus Metadata</h1>

<p>A crucial part of the Qualitas Corpus, and what really makes it a curated
collection, rather than just a bunch of downloaded files, is the information
that has been gathered on the different systems and versions, generally
referred to as <em>metadata</em>. There are different types of metadata, and
it is presented in different ways, as described below.


<dl>
<dt>Attributes</dt>
<dd>
Each System or <a href="../glossary.html#sysver">Sysver</a> has a
number of <a href="attributes.html">attributes</a> whose values are recorded (specifically
in the <tt>summary.csv</tt> and <tt>.properties</tt> files described
below).
</dd>

<dt><tt>summary.csv</tt></dt>
<dd>
This is a single file for the corpus with tab-separated entries for each
sysver that contains the values of the attributes mentioned above of the
sysver into one place. Where the attributes are system-level attibutes, each
sysver entry will have the same value.  This file is found in the
top-level <a href="../distribution.html">metadata</a> directory. The
values in this file for one sysver are also found in the sysver's
<tt>.properties</tt> file.

<p>This is new as of release <a href="../history/20100719.html">20100719</a>
and was restructured for <a href="../history/20120401.html">20120401</a>.

<dt><tt>.properties</tt> file

<dd>This file <a href="../structure.html">exists</a> for every sysver, and
contains the attribute values for that version. The same information is
found as for the sysver entry in the <tt>summary.csv</tt> file.  This file
is formatted so that it can be easily managed using
<tt><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html">java.util.Properties</a></tt>.

<p>
As of <a href="../history/20120401.html">20120401</a>, this file contains
the same information as is found in <tt>summary.csv</tt>.

<dt><tt>contents.csv</tt>
<dd>
This file exists for every sysver (in the
sysver <a href="../structure.html">metadata</a> directory) and contains the
<a href="contents.html">details</a> for every Java type found in either the
<b>bin</b> or <b>src</b> (or both) for that version. 

<p>This is new as of
release <a href="../history/20100719.html">20100719</a>.

<dt><b>Third-party library use</b>
<dd>
This describes which systems in the corpus
use <a href="thirdparty.html">third party libraries</a>, and of those, which
do or do not distribute those libraries.
This is new as of release <a href="../history/20100719.html">20100719</a>.
