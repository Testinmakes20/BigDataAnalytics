<h1>Qualitas Corpus Metadata Attributes</h1>

This page defines all of the attributes for
which <a href="index.html">metadata</a> is provided in the Qualitas Corpus.

<p>Attributes come in two flavours. Some apply to systems and some
apply to <a href="../glossary.html">sysvers</a>.

<h3>System Attributes</h3>

<dl>
<p><dt>system</dt>
<dd>
The <a href="../conventions.html">unique identifier</a>
for a <a href="../system.html">unit of development</a> that can be deployed.
</dd>

<p><dt>status</dt>
<dd>
An indication of the <a href="status.html">development status</a>
of the system.
</dd>

<p><dt>description</dt>
<dd>
A short description of the system.
</dd>

<p><dt>systemnotes</dt>
<dd>
Notes regarding system, e.g. explanation of status.
</dd>

<p><dt>sysvercount</dt>
<dd>
Number of versions of the system in the release of the corpus.
</dd>

</dl>

<h3>Sysver Attributes</h3>

<dl>
<p><dt>sysver</dt>
<dd>
A <a href="../conventions.html">unique identifier</a> for the version of the
system that is in the corpus. This identifier follows the 
<a href="../conventions.html">naming conventions</a>.
</dd>

<p><dt><a name="fullname">fullname</a></dt>
<dd>
The full name of the system the version belongs to. This is often the
<a href="#system">system</a> attribute, but can be different when the
full name is too awkward to use as the system identifier. This is
not a system level attribute to accommodate systems that change names.
</dd>

<p><dt><a name="distribution">distribution</a></dt>
<dd>
Which distribution does the sysver appear in: 'e' - evolution, 'r' -
recent, 'f' - full.
</dd>

<p><dt>domain</dt>
<dd>
An <a href="domain-model.html">indication of the purpose</a> of the system.
</dd>

<!--
<p><dt>ignorepkg</dt>
<dd>
Comma-separated list of package prefixes. Similar in nature to
<a href="#sourcepackages">sourcepackages</a>, but identifies packages
for which either source or binary exists in the distribution for the
sysver, but which is not considered part of the system. This is useful
for removing extraneous information for some forms of analysis.
</dd>
-->

<p><dt>jreversion</dt>
<dd>
The earliest <a href="jre-version.html">JRE version</a> that the sysver
depends on.
</dd>

<p><dt><a name="license">license</a></dt>
<dd>
The license under which the system has been released. 
The format for this data is:
<blockquote>
<em>human readable license identifier</em> ";" <em>path to license text</em>
</blockquote>
An example is
<pre>
Eclipse Public License - v 1.0; src/eclipse/epl-v10.html
</pre>
The <em>human readable license identifier</em> will typically be the
title text of the license or something similar that uniquely identifies
the license. Ideally the <em>path to license text</em>
will be a path relative to the installation of the sysver to the
license text. This is preferred to (for example) a URL, since the URL
can become stale, so a URL is only provided when no license text is
distributed. Details as to the reliability of this information
are <a href="license.html">available</a>.
</dd>

<p><dt><a name="loc(both)">loc(both)</a></dt>
<dd>
The sum of the <a href="../glossary.html#loc">LOC</a> values from
the <a href="contents.html">contents details</a> metadata for all <a href="../glossary.html#type">types</a> that
are in the
<a href="#sourcepackages">source packages</a>, and that
appear in <em>both</em> <b>src</b> and <b>bin</b>. 

<p>This value has to
apply to types for which there is source code (otherwise LOC has no
meaning) and it doesn't seem sensible to include types for which there
is source code but no binary, hence the "both" designation.
</dd>

<p><dt><a name="n_bin">n_bin</a></dt>
<dd>
The number of types found in the <a href="contents.html">contents
details</a> metadata for all types that are in the
<a href="#sourcepackages">source packages</a>, and that
appear in the <b>bin</b>. This is considered the definitive set of types for
the system, as this is what is actually deployed.

<p>This is one candidate for determining the number
of <a href="../glossary.html#type">types</a> in the system. The reasoning
for this choice is, types for which there is a compiled version are intended
to be part of the system so must be counted, even if there is no source
available (e.g. because it is generated). Note that LOC/NCLOC measurements
may not exist for all types.
</dd>

<p><dt><a name="n_both">n_both</a></dt>
<dd>
The number of types found in the <a href="contents.html">contents
details</a> metadata
for all types that are in the
<a href="#sourcepackages">source packages</a>, and that
appear in <em>both</em> <b>src</b> and <b>bin</b>.

<p>This is another means to measure the number of types in the system. The
reasoning is, types for which there is source but no binary are probably
infrastructural (e.g. testing) or examples or similar. Types for which there
are binary but not source are probably generated.
</dd>

<p><dt><a name="n_files">n_files</a></dt>
<dd>
The number of source files found in the <a href="contents.html">contents
details</a> metadata for all types that are in the
<a href="#sourcepackages">source packages</a>, and that
appear in the <b>src</b>.
</dd>

<p><dt><a name="n_top(bin)">n_top(bin)</a></dt>
<dd>
The number of top-level types found in the <a href="contents.html">contents
details</a> metadata for all types that are in the
<a href="#sourcepackages">source packages</a>, and that
appear in the <b>bin</b>.

<p>This might not always match <a href="#n_files"><tt>n_files</tt></a>
if there are files with multiple top-level types declared (meaning some
must be non-public).
</dd>

<p><dt><a name="ncloc(both)">ncloc(both)</a></dt>
<dd>
The sum of the 
<a href="../glossary.html#ncloc">NCLOC</a> values from
the <a href="contents.html">contents details</a> metadata for all types that
are in the
<a href="#sourcepackages">source packages</a>, and that
appear in <em>both</em> <b>src</b> and <b>bin</b>.

<p>This value has to
apply to types for which there is source code (otherwise LOC has no
meaning) and it doesn't seem sensible to include types for which there
is source code but no binary, hence the "both" designation.
</dd>

<p><dt><a name="releasedate">releasedate</a></dt>
<dd>
The release date of the sysver. This date is determined ideally by a notice
in the distribution or on the system website, but sometimes has to be
guessed by looking at dates of files in the distribution. The
<a href="#versionnotes">versionnotes</a> attribute should indicate how
this was determined.
</dd>
<p><dt><a name="sourcepackages">sourcepackages</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Records the decision we have made regarding what is 
<a href="../system.html">in a system</a> (and not, for example,
third-party library types). This is a space-separated list of <em>prefixes</em>
of packages of Java types. Any type (class, interface, enum, annotation)
whose binary name has one of the listed package prefix as a prefix of it is
considered a type that was developed for the system, and everything else is
considered as being a library type.

<p>So, for azureus-3.0.3.4, its sourcepackages value is
"<tt>org.gudy. HTML. com.aelitis.</tt>", indicating that types such as
<tt>com.aelitis.azureus.core.AzureusCore</tt> are considered part of that
version of azureus, whereas <tt>java.lang.String</tt> would not.
</dd>

<p><dt><a name="url">url</a></dt>
<dd>
A web site for the version. Typically this is the system's home page,
but as this may change over time this is kept at the version level.
</dd>

<p><dt><a name="versionnotes">versionnotes</a></dt>
<dd>
Version specific notes, e.g. how release date was determined.
</dd>
