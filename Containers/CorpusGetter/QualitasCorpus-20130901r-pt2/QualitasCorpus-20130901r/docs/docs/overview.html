<h1>Qualitas Corpus Overview</h1>

The Qualitas Corpus is in fact a set of corpora (so perhaps it should have
been called the Qualitas Corpora but it's probably too late now!), each
containing a different set of "releases". A release consists of a 
set of versions of <em><a href="system.html">systems</a></em>.

<p>What distinguishes releases from each other is their contents. Some
releases are distributed in different ways, each way being referred to as a
"distribution". To use the corpus, one decides which distribution is
required, which dictates which release one will get, and then goes
about <a href="acquisition.html">acquiring the distribution</a>. Each
distribution contains, for each system
version, <a href="structure.html#compressed">archive files</a> corresponding to
what is provide on the system download site, plus various support
information and <a href="metadata/index.html">metadata</a>.

<p>Having obtained a distribution, one must
now <a href="installation.html">install</a> it, which will result in some
documentation (including these pages), and a set of versions of
systems, <a href="structure.html">organised</a> hierarchically by system and
then version, with the archive files partially unpacked. Note that if the
installation is not done, then none of the systems will be unpacked, and so
there will be little to analyse. Also, what is place in
the <a href="structure.html#bin">bin</a> directory is usually not everything
that appears in the relevant
<a href="structure.html#compressed">archive file</a>, however as we
provide the original archive file anything we don't unpack is still
available.

<p>We provide <a href="metadata/index.html">metadata</a> for each version of
each system in the corpus.  Possibly the most useful is
the <a href="metadata/attributes.html#sourcepackages">sourcepackages</a>
data. A typical analysis run would load up all the source or bytecodes and
then use the sourcepackages values to distinguish the types that were
written for the system from those from external libraries.
